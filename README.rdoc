== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
Before getting started on Server, run the script server_setup.sh
This script will install the necessary packages, creates a deploy user who manages our Rails application,
downloads and installs RVM and Ruby, and add your ssh public key to the instanceâ€™s authorized keys.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version ~> 1.9.2
* Rails version ~> 4.0.0


* Database creation
  setup the postgresql database on server

* Database initialization--
  rake db:create
  rake db:migrate


* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
In this application we are using sidekiq for background stuff such as fetching page title from given url
once application is setup then you can start the sidekiq process by running command in terminal 'sidekiq'

* Deployment instructions
run in terminal
bundle exec cap production deploy



Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
